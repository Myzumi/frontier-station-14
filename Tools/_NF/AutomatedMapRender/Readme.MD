This Script was written to be Automated and used combined with a Service to Display the Renders.
This will currently take all Shuttles existing in `Resources\Prototypes\_NF\Shipyard` but can be changed by editing the Path in index.js:8

The Script will grab all Shuttles and put them into a ShipyardData.json where things like Description, Price, Class etc is saved for each shipyard and ship.
This is Primarily used by the Frontier bot but can also be used by other Services.

After that, The Script will automatically build the MapRenderer.
Once Build it will start Converting the Shuttles to Images.

The Script has a build in Limit on how many Child Processes it will start, which can be changed at the beginning of the index.js file
All Images will end up inside ShuttleRenders/shipname/shipname.png (As Map.Renderer puts them out, but "-0" removed from the file names)

After the script has Finished running, it will put out a Statistic.json file, listing all Finished and Failed Shuttles at once.
